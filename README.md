# esphome_fp2_ng

Custom ESPHome firmware for the Aqara FP2 Presence Sensor with full feature extraction: per-zone people counting, sleep monitoring, fall detection, posture tracking, and factory-calibrated light sensing.

Forked from [hansihe/esphome_fp2](https://github.com/hansihe/esphome_fp2) with extensive bug fixes, new features, and comprehensive reverse engineering documentation.

## What This Does

Replaces the stock ESP32 firmware on the Aqara FP2 with ESPHome, while keeping the TI IWR6843AOP radar firmware intact. This gives you **local-only** access to data that Aqara normally locks behind HomeKit and their cloud:

- **Per-zone people counting** — native radar counting (SubID 0x0175), not position approximation
- **Global people count** — total detected persons
- **Sleep monitoring** — heart rate, respiration rate, heart rate deviation
- **Fall detection** — binary sensor for fall events
- **Posture tracking** — per-zone standing/sitting/lying detection
- **Walking distance** — cumulative distance sensor
- **Real-time target tracking** — individual target positions with configurable publish rate
- **Zone presence and motion** — per-zone binary sensors with presence inference
- **Factory-calibrated light sensor** — OPT3001 with per-unit NVS calibration
- **Accelerometer corrections** — factory calibration from NVS
- **Radar firmware OTA** — XMODEM-1K update mechanism (experimental)
- **Auto-calibration** — room boundary and interference detection buttons

All data stays local. No Aqara cloud dependency.

## Changes from Upstream

See [docs/06-changelog.md](docs/06-changelog.md) for the original changelog.

**Bug fixes:**
- Switch fall-through in report handler (malformed packets misinterpreted)
- Null pointer crashes when global zone sensors not configured
- ESP-IDF 5.5+ compilation error (`driver/i2c.h` removed)
- Wall mounting mode broken in Lovelace card
- PI constant typo in accelerometer
- Presence detection state interpretation (0=empty, non-zero=occupied)
- Zone presence inference from motion/people count (0x0142 may not fire on boot)
- Stale sensor states cleared on presence-off cascade (sleep, people count, posture)
- Location reporting always enabled at radar level (people counting dependency)
- **All three grids (edge, interference, exit) always sent during init** — radar silently suppresses presence/motion reports if any grid is missing
- Double-init at 45 seconds — radar ACKs commands during boot but doesn't apply them

**New features:**
- Global people count sensor
- Per-zone native people counting (SubID 0x0175)
- Per-zone posture tracking (standing/sitting/lying)
- Fall detection via 0x0155 PEOPLE_COUNTING (Ghidra-confirmed source)
- Sleep monitoring: state, presence, heart rate, respiration, heart rate deviation
- Walking distance sensor
- Radar state diagnostic sensor (Booting/Init sent/Re-init/Ready/Presence)
- OPT3001 ambient light with factory NVS calibration
- Accelerometer factory NVS corrections
- Configurable target tracking publish rate (default 500ms)
- Radar firmware OTA via XMODEM-1K (experimental)
- Data-bearing RESPONSE frame routing (fixes missing zone reports)
- Improved Lovelace card: throttled updates, posture-aware targets, auto-tracking

**Reverse engineering:**
- Complete UART protocol spec with 43+ SubIDs documented
- SubID 0x0203 zone config sync mechanism (fully traced)
- SubID 0x0155 PEOPLE_COUNTING blob structure (7 bytes: zone, count, ontime)
- Fall detection path: radar FUN_00015624 sends 0x0155, not 0x0121
- Radar OTA XMODEM-1K protocol (all parameters, function addresses)
- NVS lux calibration algorithm (two-range piecewise linear)
- Handler registration table (139 entries, 32 bytes each)
- Stock firmware init sequence and radar boot timing

## Zone Grid

Zones are defined as 14x14 ASCII grids. Each cell maps to a region of the detection area (~0.5m x 0.5m):

- `.` or space = inactive
- `X` or `x` = active detection cell

```yaml
grid: |-
  ..............
  ..XXXX........
  ..XXXX........
  ..XXXX........
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
```

## Radar Init Behaviour

The radar requires **all three grids** to be sent during init for presence/motion reports (SubID 0x0103/0x0104) to work:

1. **Edge grid** (0x0107) — Room boundary
2. **Entry/exit grid** (0x0109) — Entry/exit zones
3. **Interference grid** (0x0110) — Interference sources

The component sends empty defaults for any grid not configured in YAML. You only need to configure `edge_grid` explicitly — the others default to empty (no interference, no entry/exit zones).

**Boot timing:** The radar ACKs commands sent during its ~38-second boot sequence but does not apply them. The component handles this with a double-init: commands are sent on first heartbeat, then re-sent at 45 seconds after boot.

**Presence delay after OTA:** After an OTA flash, the radar may take 2-5 minutes before it begins producing presence/motion reports. The `radar_state` sensor tracks progress: Booting → Init sent → Re-init → Ready → Presence. Target tracking (0x0117) starts immediately, but presence reports are delayed. This is normal radar behaviour — a full power cycle may produce faster results.

## Known Limitations

- **Fall detection** — Now implemented via SubID 0x0155 (PEOPLE_COUNTING),
  confirmed by Ghidra analysis of the radar firmware (`FUN_00015624` sends
  0x0155 with "Fall area: %d, %d" debug string). The radar does NOT send
  SubID 0x0121 directly. Fall is detected when the ontime value in the
  0x0155 payload is non-zero. The old 0x0121 handler is kept as a fallback.

- **Sleep state** — Only values 0 (awake), 1 (light sleep), 2 (deep sleep)
  exist in the radar firmware. No REM detection.

- **Presence delay after OTA** — The radar may take 2-5 minutes after an OTA
  flash before it starts producing presence reports. Target tracking works
  immediately. Use the `radar_state` sensor to monitor boot progress.

## Factory Calibration

The component automatically reads per-unit calibration data from the factory NVS partition (`fctry`) if it was preserved during flashing:

- **Lux calibration**: two-range piecewise linear correction for the OPT3001
- **Accelerometer corrections**: per-axis offset compensation

This data is written during Aqara manufacturing and is unique to each unit. Back up your full flash before flashing ESPHome to preserve it.

## Requirements

- ESPHome 2024.6+ (ESP-IDF framework)
- Home Assistant 2024.x+ (for card)
- HACS (recommended for card installation)

## Hardware

The FP2 contains:
- **ESP32-SOLO1** (single-core) — runs this firmware
- **TI IWR6843AOP** — 60GHz mmWave radar (firmware untouched by default)
- **MiraMEMS da218B** — accelerometer for orientation (I2C 0x27)
- **TI OPT3001** — ambient light sensor (I2C 0x44), factory-calibrated via NVS

Flashing requires soldering to UART test points. See [FLASHING.md](FLASHING.md).

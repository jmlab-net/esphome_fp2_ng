# esphome_fp2_ng

> **TL;DR:** Full-featured ESPHome firmware for the Aqara FP2 presence sensor — unlocks per-zone people counting, sleep monitoring, fall detection, posture tracking, and real-time target visualisation. All local, no cloud.

The Aqara FP2 is a remarkable piece of hardware — an ESP32 paired with a TI IWR6843AOP 60GHz mmWave radar capable of tracking individual people through walls, monitoring heart rate and respiration during sleep, and detecting falls. Unfortunately, Aqara locks most of this behind HomeKit and their cloud.

This project replaces the stock ESP32 firmware with ESPHome, giving you local-only access to everything the radar can do: per-zone presence and motion detection, native people counting, sleep state monitoring with heart rate and respiration, fall detection with configurable overtime alerts, posture tracking (standing/sitting/lying), walking distance, and real-time target position streaming.

Every feature has been validated against both the stock ESP32 firmware and the TI radar firmware through comprehensive Ghidra reverse engineering. The complete UART protocol (50+ SubIDs) is documented, and a custom Lovelace card provides live radar visualisation with zone overlays and posture-aware target tracking.

## What This Does

Replaces the stock ESP32 firmware on the Aqara FP2 with ESPHome, while keeping the TI IWR6843AOP radar firmware intact. This gives you **local-only** access to data that Aqara normally locks behind HomeKit and their cloud:

- **Per-zone people counting** — native radar counting (SubID 0x0175), not position approximation
- **Global people count** — total detected persons
- **Sleep monitoring** — heart rate, respiration rate, heart rate deviation
- **Fall detection** — binary sensor for fall events
- **Posture tracking** — per-zone standing/sitting/lying detection
- **Walking distance** — cumulative distance sensor
- **Real-time target tracking** — individual target positions with configurable publish rate
- **Zone presence and motion** — per-zone binary sensors with presence inference
- **Factory-calibrated light sensor** — OPT3001 with per-unit NVS calibration
- **Accelerometer corrections** — factory calibration from NVS
- **Radar firmware OTA** — XMODEM-1K update mechanism (experimental)
- **Auto-calibration** — room boundary and interference detection buttons

All data stays local. No Aqara cloud dependency.

## Changes from Upstream

See [docs/06-changelog.md](docs/06-changelog.md) for the original changelog.

**Bug fixes:**
- Switch fall-through in report handler (malformed packets misinterpreted)
- Null pointer crashes when global zone sensors not configured
- ESP-IDF 5.5+ compilation error (`driver/i2c.h` removed)
- Wall mounting mode broken in Lovelace card
- PI constant typo in accelerometer
- Presence detection state interpretation (0=empty, non-zero=occupied)
- Zone presence inference from motion/people count (0x0142 may not fire on boot)
- Stale sensor states cleared on presence-off cascade (sleep, people count, posture)
- Location reporting always enabled at radar level (people counting dependency)
- **All three grids (edge, interference, exit) always sent during init** — radar silently suppresses presence/motion reports if any grid is missing
- Double-init at 45 seconds — radar ACKs commands during boot but doesn't apply them

**New features:**
- Global people count sensor
- Per-zone native people counting (SubID 0x0175)
- Per-zone posture tracking (standing/sitting/lying)
- Fall detection via 0x0155 PEOPLE_COUNTING (Ghidra-confirmed source)
- Sleep monitoring: state, presence, heart rate, respiration, heart rate deviation
- Walking distance sensor
- Radar state diagnostic sensor (Booting/Init sent/Re-init/Ready/Presence)
- OPT3001 ambient light with factory NVS calibration
- Accelerometer factory NVS corrections
- Configurable target tracking publish rate (default 500ms)
- Radar firmware OTA via XMODEM-1K (experimental)
- Data-bearing RESPONSE frame routing (fixes missing zone reports)
- Improved Lovelace card: throttled updates, posture-aware targets, auto-tracking

**Reverse engineering:**
- Complete UART protocol spec with 43+ SubIDs documented
- SubID 0x0203 zone config sync mechanism (fully traced)
- SubID 0x0155 PEOPLE_COUNTING blob structure (7 bytes: zone, count, ontime)
- Fall detection path: radar FUN_00015624 sends 0x0155, not 0x0121
- Radar OTA XMODEM-1K protocol (all parameters, function addresses)
- NVS lux calibration algorithm (two-range piecewise linear)
- Handler registration table (139 entries, 32 bytes each)
- Stock firmware init sequence and radar boot timing

## Zone Grid

Zones are defined as 14x14 ASCII grids. Each cell maps to a region of the detection area (~0.5m x 0.5m):

- `.` or space = inactive
- `X` or `x` = active detection cell

```yaml
grid: |-
  ..............
  ..XXXX........
  ..XXXX........
  ..XXXX........
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
  ..............
```

## Radar Init Behaviour

The radar requires **all three grids** to be sent during init for presence/motion reports (SubID 0x0103/0x0104) to work:

1. **Edge grid** (0x0107) — Room boundary
2. **Entry/exit grid** (0x0109) — Entry/exit zones
3. **Interference grid** (0x0110) — Interference sources

The component sends empty defaults for any grid not configured in YAML. You only need to configure `edge_grid` explicitly — the others default to empty (no interference, no entry/exit zones).

**Boot timing:** The radar ACKs commands sent during its ~38-second boot sequence but does not apply them. The component handles this with a double-init: commands are sent on first heartbeat, then re-sent at 45 seconds after boot.

**Presence delay after OTA:** After an OTA flash, the radar may take 2-5 minutes before it begins producing presence/motion reports. The `radar_state` sensor tracks progress: Booting → Init sent → Re-init → Ready → Presence. Target tracking (0x0117) starts immediately, but presence reports are delayed. This is normal radar behaviour — a full power cycle may produce faster results.

## Operating Modes

![Aqara App Modes](images/aqara_app_modes.jpeg)

The stock Aqara app presents four operating modes. Each mode uses a **different radar firmware image** stored in the ESP32's `mcu_ota` partition (4MB). The stock app flashes the appropriate firmware to the radar when switching modes.

### Radar Firmware Images

The `mcu_ota` partition contains three TI IWR6843 firmware images (confirmed via binary analysis):

| Firmware | Offset | Size | Source Path | Used By |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| **FW1** | 0x000000 | 768KB | `../mss/` `../dss/` | Zone Detection |
| **FW2** | 0x0C0000 | 896KB | `E:/workspace/update12/3d_people_counting_*/` | Fall Detection, Fall + Positioning |
| **FW3** | 0x1A0000 | 708KB | `C:/ti/mmwave_industrial_toolbox_4_11_0/Vital_Signs/` | Sleep Monitoring |

### Capabilities by Firmware

| Capability | FW1 | FW2 | FW3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Presence detection | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Zone configuration | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Bed height / overhead height | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Basic people counting | Yes | --- | --- |
| Fall area reporting | Yes | --- | --- |
| Deep learning fall detection | --- | **Yes** | --- |
| ML scoring / DSP scoring | --- | **Yes** | --- |
| Height estimation | --- | **Yes** | --- |
| Fall recognition timing | --- | **Yes** | --- |
| 3D people counting | --- | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Vital signs chain | --- | --- | **Yes** |
| Heart rate / respiration | --- | --- | **Yes** |

### Mode to Firmware Mapping

| App Mode | Firmware | Mounting | Persons | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Zone Detection** | FW1 | Wall | Multi | Presence, motion, zones, basic people counting |
| **Fall Detection** | FW2 | Ceiling | Single | Deep learning fall detection with ML scoring |
| **Sleep Monitoring** | FW3 | Bedside | Single | Vital signs: heart rate, respiration, sleep state |
| **Fall + Positioning** | FW2 | Ceiling | Single | Fall detection with real-time target streaming |

### Current Implementation Status

The `operating_mode` select currently switches the radar's **scene mode** (3, 8, or 9) within the active firmware. This works correctly for Zone Detection (FW1 is the default firmware). However:

- **Sleep Monitoring** and **Fall Detection** modes set the scene mode but do not produce their full feature set because they require **different radar firmware images** (FW3 and FW2 respectively).
- The **radar firmware OTA** mechanism (XMODEM-1K via SubID 0x0127) is implemented but **untested**. Enabling full mode switching would require flashing the appropriate firmware image from the `mcu_ota` partition to the radar on each mode change.
- All three firmware images share the same Aqara UART protocol (`communication.c`), so the ESPHome component's SubID handlers work with any of them.

### AI Learning

The stock app's "AI Learning" feature triggers both edge and interference auto-calibration simultaneously while the room is empty. Use the `calibrate_edge` and `calibrate_interference` buttons together to replicate this — ensure the room is clear first.

## Known Limitations

- **Sleep monitoring requires radar firmware swap** — The vital signs processing
  (heart rate, respiration) runs on FW3, a completely separate radar firmware
  from the default FW1. The operating mode select sets scene mode 9 but does not
  yet flash FW3 to the radar. Radar OTA is implemented but untested.

- **Advanced fall detection requires radar firmware swap** — FW2 has deep learning
  fall detection with ML scoring, distinct from FW1's basic fall algorithm.
  The basic fall detection (SubID 0x0306) in FW1 requires ceiling mounting.

- **Sleep state** — Only values 0 (awake), 1 (light sleep), 2 (deep sleep)
  exist in the radar firmware. No REM detection.

- **Presence delay after OTA** — The radar may take 2-5 minutes after an OTA
  flash before it starts producing presence reports. Target tracking works
  immediately. Use the `radar_state` sensor to monitor boot progress.

## Factory Calibration

The component automatically reads per-unit calibration data from the factory NVS partition (`fctry`) if it was preserved during flashing:

- **Lux calibration**: two-range piecewise linear correction for the OPT3001
- **Accelerometer corrections**: per-axis offset compensation

This data is written during Aqara manufacturing and is unique to each unit. Back up your full flash before flashing ESPHome to preserve it.

## Hardware

The FP2 contains:
- **ESP32-SOLO1** (single-core) — runs this firmware
- **TI IWR6843AOP** — 60GHz mmWave radar (firmware untouched by default)
- **MiraMEMS da218B** — accelerometer for orientation (I2C 0x27)
- **TI OPT3001** — ambient light sensor (I2C 0x44), factory-calibrated via NVS

Flashing requires soldering to UART test points. See [FLASHING.md](FLASHING.md).
